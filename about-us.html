              There are a lot of event companies that do what we do. They “Definitely” share the same "What" and "How". What makes us really different is our “Why”.<br>

                We create “Experiences” not just “Events”. We love crafting every project with a true passion & attention to detail and we value relationships above all else..<br>

                We are focused on turning dreams to reality. Innovating, pushing boundaries, and insisting on nothing but perfection from ourselves. Our wide-range of expertise has allowed us to create parties for all occasions.<br>
                So, let's party!

              Designing the menu for your event usually happens in a face to face meeting or over phone with the caterer, which is a very time consuming process. GingerBee makes the whole thing very simple by giving you control on designing the menu by each session - Breakfast,Lunch,Evening snack and Dinner.
            </p>

            <i class="fa fa-users" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            <h6><b>people</b></h6>
            <p>Enter number of guests for each session</p>


            <i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            <h7><b>caterer</b></h7>
            <p>
              We have curated list of caterers from each city. Each caterer's menu has been digitized for your ease of consumption. You can checkout the menu before choosing the caterer.
            </p>


            <i class="fa fa-check-square-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
            <h8><b>book</b></h8>
            <p>
              Once the meal plan is designed , getting quote is very easy. After requesting quote, caterer will reply back in-app with the quote. We do not give your phone number to the caterers, so you don't have to worry about unnecessary calls. Once you receive the quote, you can explore other caterers and compare quote or finalize the caterer by paying a booking advance.
